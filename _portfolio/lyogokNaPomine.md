# Lyogok na pomine

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/portfolio/lyogokNaPomine.jpg" alt="Lyogok na pomine" %}

Witty comedy about the cunning estate agent Pasha, who randomly receives a strange feature. The unfortunate realtor has to wander literally all over the world and constantly find himself next to people who remember him with an unkind word.
