{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/portfolio/chapay.jpg" alt="Strasti po Chapayu" %}

This is the very first feature to have ever told a story of the Russian revolutionary, Chapaev, in such a gripping and heart-stirring manner. The series takes us through thorny days of the national hero as the numerous layers of love and hate, pride and shame, great victory and inconsolable loss unfold. The abundance of action and raw emotion enlighten the viewer to the innumerable twists and turns on the path to the final victory of the Red Army and Chapaev's agonizing solitude. War shatters the existence of the main character when it claims the life of his beloved wife. Desperate and inconsolable, Chapaev remarries just to find what betrayal and disappointment taste like. Having lost his wife to another man, he joins the Red Army to ease the pain of abandonment. Now the future hero must adhere to the cause of the disenfranchised people, like himself, in a fight for a better future. Through epic battles, bloodbaths and selfless heroism, Chapaev will blaze through the pages of history books right to the glorious victory. But no recognition and fame can fill the hole in his heart, aching for the person long lost, leaving the hero forever alone on his pedestal. This is a story of harsh times, atrocious violence, lost chances and rooky mistakes. The plot masterly incorporates the great tragedy of the Russian people and the heartbreaking love story into one breathtaking series.
